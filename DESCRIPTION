Description: Tools for precise surface area calculations on geographic
    data in WGS84 coordinate system. Implements ellipsoid-based
    calculations to overcome area distortion in latitude-longitude
    projections. Provides functions to create area rasters, convert
    polygons to area rasters, and perform zonal statistics with
    accurate area measurements. Essential for land cover analysis,
    remote sensing applications, and geographic studies requiring
    exact surface area computations.
